movie_search :
Check current folder for files *.txt and shows the lines that match the search string.
Initially made for my movie and comics collections.
I create my txt file with the command "dir /s /b >harddisk_list.txt".
I have a txt file for each of my storage media so I can locate in which media what I want is stored.
